## Careers in Computer Science 

<center> <h1> Neural Network Engineer | Deep Learning Engineer </h1></center>


### By Gregory Lui 

## **About**
A deep learning engineer falls under a branch of machine learning engineering that deals with <u>[artificial neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks)</u>. These neural networks are used to process data in a way similar to humans. Because the human brain is so complex, a machine that takes advantage of a similar process as a brain will have a significant advantage over other machine learning models.
