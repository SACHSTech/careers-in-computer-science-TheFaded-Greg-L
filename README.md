## **About**
A deep learning engineer falls under a branch of machine learning engineering that deals with <u>[artificial neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks)</u>. These neural networks are used to process data in a way similar to humans. Because the human brain is so complex, a machine that takes advantage of a similar process as a brain will have a significant advantage over other machine learning models.

## **Duties and Responsibilities**
Deep learning engineers are required to know how to deal with this complex neural network in terms of algorithms and technology. They are responsible not only for understanding these neural networks but also for training them to understand correctly. Compared to a standard machine learning engineer, a neural network engineer has more of an application in terms of what the general public uses. For instance, a deep learning engineer works with software developers to develop a neural network AI that detects images. This is different from a machine learning engineer who works with data scientists to process large amounts of data via complex AI-related algorithms.

<center> <h1><b> Education </b> </h> </center>

## **About**

The education pathway to becoming a Deep Learning Engineer varies extensively. One path towards this position is through the <u>[University of Waterloo's Computer Science program](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/future-undergraduate-students/undergraduate-programs-and-courses/computer-science)</u>. This program allows applicants to develop their understanding in various different areas. One of which is the specialization of Artificial Intelligence.

<p/>

***

## **Requirements**

### This <u> [program](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computer-science)</u> has several academic requirements to get in. It requires minimum 90s in six Grade 12 U _and/or_ M courses including:

1. **Advanced Functions _(MHF4U)_**
2. **Calculus and Vectors _(MCV4U)_**
3. **Gr. 12 English _(ENG4U)_**
4. **One Other 4U Course _(Recommended: ICS3U)_**

### Apart from Grades there are other ways to assist in getting into the program such as participating in Waterloo Contests:

* **Canadian Computing Competition _(CCC)_**
* **Canadian Senior Mathematics Contest _(CSMC)_**
* **Euclid Mathematics Contest**

***

## **First Year Students**

### Students in their first year can expect to take courses such as:

* **Introduction to Computer Science/Designing Function Programs _(CS115, CS135 or CS145)_**
* **Elementary Algorith Design and Data Abstraction _(CS136 or CS146)_**
* **Calculus 1 _(MATH127, MATH137 or MATH147)_**
* **Calculus 2 _(MATH128, MATH138, or MATH148)_**
* **Algebra _(MATH135 or MATH145)_**
* **Linear Algebra _(MATH136 or MATH146)_**

***

## **Program Length and Co-op**

### This program can last anywhere between **4-5 years** depending on particular pathways chosen such as <u>[co-op](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/co-op)</u> or additional degrees.

> The University of Waterloo’s Computer Science program offers co-op with a massive network of companies. This allows students to get workplace experience and connections. Many large companies have a team or teams of engineers working on neural networks. A co-op can get first-hand experience with AI as well as get students connected to companies working on it.

<center> <h1><b> Skills </b> </h> </center>

### Being a Deep Learning Engineer requires many skills, both technical and non-technical. For most jobs, the main thing that is required is experience. Being able to collaborate and work with a team is more important than any technical skill, especially since the development of AI is so rapid.

## **Technical Skills**

* **Thorough understanding and skills relating to machine learning, data science, mathematics, algorithmic coding, and software engineering.**
* **Proficient knowledge in these programming languages: Python, Matlab, Linux, and C++.**
* **Able to understand AI resources such as TensorFlow, or PyTorch.**
* **Ability to use cloud-based technologies such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.**

***

## **Non-technical Skills**

* **Patience (AI takes a while to train)**
* **Communication Skills**
* **Collaboration Skills**
* **Leadership Skills**
* **Independent Worker Skills**
