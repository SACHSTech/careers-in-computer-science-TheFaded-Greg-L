## Careers in Computer Science 

<center> <h1> Neural Network Engineer | Deep Learning Engineer </h1></center>


### By Gregory Lui 

## **About**
A deep learning engineer falls under a branch of machine learning engineering that deals with <u>[artificial neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks)</u>. These neural networks are used to process data in a way similar to humans. Because the human brain is so complex, a machine that takes advantage of a similar process as a brain will have a significant advantage over other machine learning models.

## **Duties and Responsibilities**
Deep learning engineers are required to know how to deal with this complex neural network in terms of algorithms and technology. They are responsible not only for understanding these neural networks but also for training them to understand correctly. Compared to a standard machine learning engineer, a neural network engineer has more of an application in terms of what the general public uses. For instance, a deep learning engineer works with software developers to develop a neural network AI that detects images. This is different from a machine learning engineer who works with data scientists to process large amounts of data via complex AI-related algorithms.

## **Education**

The education pathway to becoming a Deep Learning Engineer varies extensively. One path towards this position is through the <u>[University of Waterloo's Computer Science program](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/future-undergraduate-students/undergraduate-programs-and-courses/computer-science)</u>. This program allows applicants to develop their understanding in various different areas. One of which is the specialization of Artificial Intelligence.

### This <u> [program](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computer-science)</u> has several academic requirements to get in. It requires minimum 90s in six Grade 12 U _and/or_ M courses including:

* **Advanced Functions _(MHF4U)_**
* **Calculus and Vectors _(MCV4U)_**
* **Gr. 12 English _(ENG4U)_**
* **One Other 4U Course _(Recommended: ICS3U)_**
